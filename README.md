Hi there, I'm Itamar (aka @CMOSfail) and welcome to my simple yet exciting project - a C# implementation of the infamous game, **Russian Roulette**! This project is aimed at helping students understand the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using a simple and fun example.

## About The Project

The game Russian Roulette originated in the 19th century and is known for its high stake risks. This project is a software version of the game, implemented in C# and it demonstrates the basic principles of OOP like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.

This project is great for students just getting started with C# or OOP because it's a fun and simple example. The game mechanics are straightforward, yet the structure can be quite complex - which makes it perfect for learning!

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* [Microsoft .NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/CMOSfail/RussianRoulette.git
   
2. Open the project in your favorite C# editor, such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). Run the code:

  ```csharp
  // Assuming you are in the root directory of the project
  cd RussianRoulette
  dotnet run
  ```

This should start the game in your terminal. Follow the on-screen instructions to play!

## Usage

Once you have the project open in your editor, you can run it. Here's a basic outline of how to play the game:

1. The game starts with a revolver which has 6 chambers, and a single bullet is randomly placed in one of these chambers.
2. You can choose to spin the chambers again (this re-randomizes the bullet's location) or pull the trigger.
3. If the bullet was in the chamber that was fired, the game is over - you lost!
4. If the bullet wasn't in the chamber that was fired, congratulations - you survived this round! You can choose to spin the chambers and pull the trigger again, or stop playing.
5. Your score is based on how many times you pull the trigger and survive.

For a detailed breakdown of the code and the OOP concepts used, please refer to the inline comments within the code files. They are there to guide you through the process and help you understand how the different OOP principles are being applied.



**Please note**: For a more in-depth explanation of how the code works and its relation to OOP concepts, please refer to the inline comments within the code files. They are there to guide you through the process and help you understand how the different OOP principles are being applied.
